  Plan a week or a month of YouTube uploads - what to post, when, and in
  what order, sized to the creator's actual capacity. Use for "plan my
  week", "content calendar", "what should I post", "I have no idea what to
  make next".

# yt-plan

A plan that does not fit the week is a list of regrets. Ask two questions before writing anything:
**how many hours do you actually have**, and **what is already half-made**.

## Before you write

1. Read the user's style card at `~/.claude/channel/style-card.md` (the same card
   `producing-channel-videos` builds and saves): who they talk to, how they talk, words they never use,
   what they will not claim, how they open and close. Also read the "My style" block in
   `~/.claude/skills/video-edit/RULES.md` for format and look. The channel is the user's own
   (Pushpstation: tech and gameplay, Hindi, Hinglish or English). If neither file says how they talk,
   ask for **three of their own videos**, read or transcribe them, and write the card with the fields
   of `producing-channel-videos/assets/style-card-template.md`. Never invent a voice and call it theirs.
2. Never invent a number, a result or a source. If a figure would strengthen it and you do not have
   one, ask for it or write the line without it.

## The shape of a week

- **One anchor.** The video the week is for. It gets the most time and it goes out on the day the
  channel's own analytics say is best - ask for that, do not assume Tuesday.
- **One cheap one.** Built from something that exists: a clip, a reaction, a follow-up to the
  comment that got the most replies last week.
- **Shorts from the anchor.** Three, cut from the long video, not written separately. `clipify` (its Shorts survival test) or
  `video-pipeline` finds and cuts them.

Three uploads on a seven-day week, not seven. A plan that posts daily is not a plan anyone
recognises, and the empty days are what make the filled ones survive a bad week.

## What to hand back

A table: day, format, working title, the one sentence it promises, and what already exists for it.
Then the honest line at the bottom - how many hours this costs, and what to drop first if the week
goes wrong.

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**
